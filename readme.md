## Electronic Purchase Order System

Developed for the accounting department so that the purchasing department (located in a building 2 miles away) could submit their purchase orders electronically instead of having to submit handwritten purchase orders. Authentication is handled through LDAP. It also utilizes queues as well as AWS S3.
